##The makeCacheMatrix creates a special matrix which caches its inverse. This special matrix
##can be subsequently called by cacheSolve. If the inverse has already been computed 
##earlier, ir returns the cached value.

## The cachesolve function takes the special matrix created using makeCacheMatrix
